   *. Lich Phylactery -- acts as a recall beacon, but only during death. If the Phylactery is destroyed then the lich loses xp and must construct a new one,
      undergoing the ritual all over again. However if they have a phylactery when they die they do not lose experience but they do have to wait until their
      corperal body is remade, giving them a waiting period in an incorporeal state.
